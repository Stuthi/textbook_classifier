ScikitLearn's CountVectorizer has been used to extract text features.

Classifiers trained :
1. Naive Bayes 
2. SVM
3. SVM with parameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Best Accuracies were obtained as follows:
- Using Category as target variable : SVM, 85.3%
- Using Sub Category as target variable : SVM, 66.8%
